        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p class="intro">I was an aviation meteorologist at the Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS)
            After my 9-year career at MSS, I stumbled upon baking one day. Stubbornly, I changed my career path,
            and I just start baking. It's like travelling to another country, exploring the uncertainty as well as
            the unknown out there, but now it's time for me to go HOME.

            <h3>Project Management</h3>
            <p class="skill-intro">When I was an aviation meteorologist, I managed developmental projects from its
                initiation, planning, execution to the closure. One main project I took charge was a website revamp for
                the aviation community. I worked closely with end users to understand their operational needs, and
                after that I designed website wireframe, performed UAT with website developer
                and prepared for the website launch. We have developed several new forecast products to assist the ATC,
                such as thunderstorm forecasts for the aerodrome, holding stacks, approach sectors and FIR sectors.</p>
